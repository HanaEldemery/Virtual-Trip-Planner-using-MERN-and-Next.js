# Tripify

Tripify is a full-stack web application designed to simplify and enhance the travel planning experience. The platform enables users to organize trips, manage travel details, and receive personalized updates through an intuitive and responsive interface. It was built using Next.js, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern, scalable, and efficient architecture.

The application features a secure authentication system with role-based authorization, allowing different levels of access and functionality depending on the user’s role. This ensures both flexibility and data protection within the platform. Users can create and manage travel plans, while administrators can oversee and manage system-wide operations.

The frontend was developed using Next.js and React to provide a dynamic and seamless user experience. Tailwind CSS was used to design a clean, responsive, and visually appealing interface that adapts smoothly across devices. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, handles API requests, business logic, and data management efficiently. MongoDB was used as the database to store and manage trip information, user data, and application records.

One of the key features of the platform is the implementation of real-time notifications, allowing users to receive immediate updates related to their trips. This enhances user engagement and ensures that important information is delivered instantly.

Overall, Virtual Trip Planner demonstrates strong full-stack development skills, including secure authentication, RESTful API design, responsive UI development, and real-time system functionality.
